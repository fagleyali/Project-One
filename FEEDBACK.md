### Your Project must be able to perform the following:

- Render a game in the browser.
- **Include win and/or loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML.** Popup alerts using the `alert()` method are okay during development, but not production.
- **Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files**.
- Have **properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. In addition, ensure that your vertical whitespace is consistent.
- No remaining **dead (code that will never be called) and/or commented out code**.
- Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) named as nouns.
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)**. Don't attempt to implement a computer opponent.  This typically requires AI which is beyond the scope of WDI.
- Write **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.
- **Use native Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** - your choice. However be consistent - it's not wise to mix & match the two approaches to accomplish similar tasks.
- **Deploy your game online** using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

## Necessary Deliverables

- **A ``README.md`` file** with these sections at a minimum:
  1. **\<Your game's title\>**: A description of your game.  Background info of the game is a nice touch.
  2. **A screenshot** or screenshots of your actual game makes your readme more colorful :)
  3. **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used.
  4. **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important. 
  5. **Next Steps**: Unsolved problems and/or planned features.
- The code for **a working game, built by you**, hosted on GitHub Pages (covered next week).
- Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit often, but don't commit broken code (unless instructed to do so for sharing with instructors, etc.). Also, commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style game board" instead of "Styled game board".

> Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well done `README.md`. The `README.md` introduces your project to prospective employers and will therefore go towards forming their first impression of your work!

## Your Feedback

**Glows (What you did well):**

Ali, excellent work for your project one! This was one of the most unique project's I've seen for Unit One! I loved the creativity and implementation in your JavaScript. Your workflow was very easy to read and understand, so I appreciate the effort you made to creating full functionality for your project. You also did an amazing job with your HTML and CSS. For all of your code, you followed many of the industry standards we taught during Unit One. So, again, thank you very much for turning in such an amazing project!


**Grows (Areas of opportunity to do even better!):**

The only areas of opportunity for improvement would be to make sure to remove any "dead code" or commented out code from your CSS before you deploy to production. Also I would make sure to be aware of excessive whitespace in your HTML. Lastly I would recommend exploring ways to avoid
writing very long JavaScript expressions (see line 84 in script.js).

Please look through your code as I've place comments to point out these items.

**Closing Notes**

You're right on track to graduate from this class, Ali! Keep up the amazing work! Please let me know if you have any questions.
